The return home and the eventual rumination on a single piece, a small wall hanging made of rectilinear clay paillettes carefully tied together. This is followed by flipping through favorite books and seeing the similarities in the textures and tactility of Anni Albers’s tapestries, which leads to Josef’s tessellating fireplaces and Eileen Gray’s graphic screens.<br\/><br\/>This collection is a tribute to these individuals. Composed of two folding screens, two tables, a pair of sconces, and a lamp, it is a study of order and relation, a study of design as Josef Albers would say. Patterns were developed, applied to the different pieces, and then mixed and remixed to achieve the most pleasing combinations. And, in a first for the studio, blackened steel was introduced, its smooth delicacy heightening the character of the clay.<br\/><br\/>Together, these pieces speak to one another through their playful contrasts, as well as their ultramarine interiors. Separately, they stand on their own (quite literally in the case of the table and screen), unpretentious objects that will be at home in spaces for years to come.<\/p>",

It’s why they vary slightly, their character the product of the day’s temperament. Yet, few pieces are designed to be handled regularly. They sit handsomely on surfaces, but are rarely picked up, turned over, and explored.<br\/><br\/>The desire to create something that formed part of a personal routine, something precious, led us to the French ceramicist and jewelry designer Mithé Espelt and, ultimately, the creation of this collection. Born in 1923, Espelt is known for her mirrors, boxes, and jewelry — small, whimsical treasures to be used as part of the everyday act of dressing.<br\/><br\/>Our mirrors and tables are a nod to her carved geometries, employing the studio’s signature slab technique to create a series of inlaid patterns. They also take Espelt’s combination of color and gilt and render it in decidedly Dumais Made shades (think rich and patinated rather than bright and radiant). The result? Precious, everyday objects that add shimmer to daily life. <\/p>",
